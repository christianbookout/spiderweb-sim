## Spiderweb Construction

1. Spider releases some extremely light silk. The silk is carried by the wind vectorfield until it reaches another solid point. 
2. The spider walks along the silk, creating another line of silk that floats just below the current one
3. The spider walks to the center of the lower silk, weighs it down, then attaches a thread to some bottom point.
4. The spider walks around the perimeter of the web, attaching it to the environment.
5. The spider builds support lines from the center of the web outwards
6. A temporary spiral is created from the inside outwards
7. The spider makes a U-turn at the end of the temporary spiral, and makes a sticky spiral (from the outside in).
